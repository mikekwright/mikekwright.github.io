    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I have used python dependencies before, however up until this point that has been \n",
    "limited to both virtualenv and pip.  I really enjoyed the system and the ability\n",
    "to be able to quickly and easily install the dependencies that I needed using\n",
    "`pip install <dependency>`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once I got to the position of needing many dependencies and running them on different\n",
    "machines I got use the requirements files `pip install -r requirements.txt`.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these systems would work well, however I noticed myself sometimes running\n",
    "into systems that were failing because of OS dependencies that were missing.  This \n",
    "was never more present then when I started to install some of the DataScience tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a this point that I stumbled across Anaconda.  I was quite surprised by this library\n",
    "and the ease at which it was to create environments, so long as I was in `bash` or `zsh`. \n",
    "The installation itself was painless and straightforward.  However what I really wanted\n",
    "was the ability to define the different dependencies that I needed and to have those\n",
    "be quickly enabled within anaconda.  Luckily this was easily accomplished using the \n",
    "environment file format.   \n",
    "\n",
    "        name: myenv\n",
    "        dependencies:\n",
    "          - numpy\n",
    "          - jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "So once I had this file created I was able to create and use this file to both create the\n",
    "virtual environment and install the dependencies in the environment, using this command.  \n",
    "\n",
    "        conda env create -f environment.yml \n",
    "        \n",
    "Now there was one issue that I ran into, and that was the desire to install a dependency\n",
    "that did not have an existing conda package.  I found that I could still install dependencies\n",
    "to the system using pip.   \n",
    "\n",
    "        name: myenv\n",
    "        dependencies:\n",

    "## Dockerize It\n",
    "\n",
    "So for me, that last part was being able to get the above system working correctly with\n",
    "a docker container. Luckily this was a very straight forward process, even allowed me to\n",
    "easily install python3.5 on ubuntu 14.04.   \n",

    "            \n",
    "This is just the basic system installing the curl command (needed to pull down the anaconda installer)\n",
    "and the build tools (aka gcc).  \n",
    "\n",
    "        RUN curl -sSL -o installer.sh https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh && \\\n",

    "            \n",
    "In the above snippet I am actually pulling down the file and installing it.  The reason I chose to\n",
    "use curl instead of the docker `ADD` command is that I wanted to keep the layers as thin as possible.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The other thing to note is the `-b` and `-f` options that are supplied with the installer.  These allow\n",
    "for us to run the installer without needing tty access by using the defaults for the installer (including\n",
    "the prefix which puts anaconda at `/root/anaconda3`).   \n",
    "\n",

    "Here we are setting up the anaconda information for the system, including some exposed ports with \n",
    "`8888` being the main port for the notebook. We also set our default commands to startup\n",
    "the jupyter notebook allowing access from non-localhost machines (which of course is needed since\n",
    "it is running in a container).   \n",
    "\n",

    "These final 3 values are useful as they allow use to create onbuild versions of the same dockerfile\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I really enjoyed using anaconda and the ease that it gave me in setting up some custom python\n",
    "environments.  I have already moved most of the existing machines that I have over to anaconda and\n",
    "am sure that I will find many more reasons to enjoy it.  \n",
