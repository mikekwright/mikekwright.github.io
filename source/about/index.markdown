# Why are you here?

This is a good question to ask yourself, and if you don't have an answer, well lets 
hope you can find one (or better yet come up with a better question as well).    

As for me, I setup this website as a location to store my throughts and experiences 
as I seek to develop my skills and hopefully expand my abilities to be a less of a 
software monkey and more of a software craftsman.    

# Background

I'm a Software Engineer who has always had a knack for working with computers.  I love to 
see the new and exciting items that are released by the community, and see where the future of 
computing is leading us.  I write code for work and for fun, and am searching out that project 
that I whole-heartily believe in to help contribute.  I'm a huge linux geek (and BSD as well), 
and love working on the linux platform (despite my 8 years of strictly windows development). 
Through this site I will share the information I learn in web development, backend development,
tool usage, testing and to shake things up hobby electronics.   

# Contact

[Send me an email](mailto:wrightcoder.github@gmail.com)  

If you have feedback or if anything I have written is a little off, let me know.  I love to hear
what I am doing wrong, because I would rather learn from my mistakes than continue down the 
wrong path.
