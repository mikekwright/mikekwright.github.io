A couple of weeks ago I came across a group at my work who had just started up going over the 
[NoSQL Distilled](http://www.amazon.com/NoSQL-Distilled-Emerging-Persistence-ebook/dp/B0090J3SYW)
book. This is a great introductory book to a lot of the ideas behind NoSQL and what makes it 
a more viable solution in some situations over a Relational Database.  

In this post I am going to cover my experiences with Key-Value NoSQL databases, specifically 
using the Riak implementation (as selected in the book). Another key-value database that I
will also cover (less than Riak) is Redis.

This post will have a number of subposts on the different areas of my use with Riak, to keep
the information better organized and to make the post a little smaller.
