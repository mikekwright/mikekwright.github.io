      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with Machine Learning since graduating from school years ago. However recently there have been a number of projects where the use of machine learning can bring a significant benefit. This lecture was a great refresher and introduction to how task can be accomplished using python.
Why should we focus on machine learning now?
The power of a machine learning algorithm is its ability to GENERALIZE from a finite set of examples.</description>
