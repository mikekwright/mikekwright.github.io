      <description>I really have enjoyed working with a $5/month hosting company for seriously small projects with few performance requirements. The service that I am using at this time is site5. They offer a great plan that works for me and the many simple projects I have been using as prototypes.
For this specific discussion I am going to talk about what I needed to do get the lastest django (v1.4) working on site5.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done much with Machine Learning since graduating from school years ago. However recently there have been a number of projects where the use of machine learning can bring a significant benefit. This lecture was a great refresher and introduction to how task can be accomplished using python.
Why should we focus on machine learning now?
The power of a machine learning algorithm is its ability to GENERALIZE from a finite set of examples.</description>

      <description>So, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I want to say that I am &amp;ldquo;late&amp;rdquo; to the game, but I can honestly say that I am glad I have finally moved to a static site generator for my blog posts. Originally when I decided to use static github pages to host my blog, I had decided to be a little bit ambitious and create an entire system using angular and my &amp;ldquo;limited&amp;rdquo; frontend skills.</description>
