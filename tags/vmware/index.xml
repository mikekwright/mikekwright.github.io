      <description>Tonight I decided I really wanted to switch to freebsd from Ubuntu. The move was not because ubuntu had issues, but rather because I felt that I would enjoy the experience of freebsd more than that of linux. It was going to be a new world, with a different way of making things work.
So the items I list below will show the steps that I went through to get freebsd working smoothly on vmware.</description>
