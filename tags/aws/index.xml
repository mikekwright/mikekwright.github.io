      <description>I am a huge fan of continuous delivery, of release code as soon at it is written and passes the automated test gates. I am also a fan of having a deployment system that can be more closely managed by me (the engineer). Using docker at work we have been able to create a system that allows us to define a running container and using gates, continuously deploy this simple container to many different environments (stage, prod, etc).</description>

      <title>EC2 Container Service</title>

      <description>At AWS re:Invent (November 2014) a new technology was introduced. This was the AWS EC2 Container Service. A service provided by AWS to run docker containers on top of EC2 instances.
We have been using docker for a while now within our organization, and I have to say that I am a huge fan of Docker. This is a great step in the right direction and I believe can help to decrease deploys to AWS while increasing stability and extensibility of a given architecture.</description>
