      <description>Today I decided to spend a little time to try out the sproutcore web framework, which has a lot of strengths centered around using appropriate programming practices.
What is Sproutcore Sproutcore is a framework that allows you to write the code in Javascript and has that code run on both the server and client. It is a very powerful library that can help you to create web applications, not to extend your existing site.</description>

There were a few oddities that had to be fixed to allow this to work, and I hope to share with you the process that we went through to allow for typescript to be successfully deployed to an ASP.</description>
