      <description>So today I was working with the datastax virtual environment (namely getting the OVA to work inside of VMWare). There was only one issue that I ran into, that was the external networking was not working out of the box. In this post I will discuss what I looked into and how I fixed the problem in the end.
To start, I am not a very savy linux guru, so the purpose of this post is to both share and record my experience so that I can go over it again in the future if needed.</description>

      <description>There is a process that I have always wanted to be more familiar with, and this process is awk. Someone might ask why I am spending my time on this tool. I would answer with&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;that is a great question&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>During sort, this session was actually a really insightful look into mouse-less productivity.
I have always been a fan of working in the console, and have actually used screen in the past. However tmux has opened up an entirely new world for me.
In this post I am going to share some of the things that I have learned from using tmux as setups I have in place for creating easy on &amp;ldquo;dev environments&amp;rdquo;.</description>
