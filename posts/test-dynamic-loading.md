# Test Dynamic Loading

This is a test post to verify that the dynamic post loading system works correctly.

When this post is added to the `/posts` directory, it should automatically be:

1. Detected by the Vite plugin
2. Added to the generated manifest
3. Copied to the public/posts directory
4. Available in the blog post list

This ensures that content creators can simply add new markdown files without needing to manually update any code.
