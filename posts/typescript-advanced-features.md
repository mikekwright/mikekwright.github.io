# Understanding TypeScript Advanced Features

TypeScript offers many advanced features that go beyond basic type annotations. In this post, we'll explore some of the more sophisticated capabilities that can significantly improve your development workflow.

## Conditional Types

Conditional types allow you to create types that depend on a condition:

```typescript
type MessageOf<T> = T extends { message: infer U } ? U : never;
```

## Mapped Types

Mapped types let you create new types by transforming properties of existing types:

```typescript
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];
};
```

## Template Literal Types

These allow you to manipulate string literals at the type level:

```typescript
type EventName<T extends string> = `on${Capitalize<T>}`;
```

These advanced features make TypeScript incredibly powerful for building robust applications with strong type safety.
